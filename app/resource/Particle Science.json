            "text": "We exist because of a series of fortunate accidents: the fact that the Sun burns at just the right rate; the fact that protons - the seeds of hydrogen - are stable, which enables stars to cook the chemical elements essential for the Earth to be built; and the fact that neutrons are slightly heavier than protons, which enables beta radioactivity, transmutation of the elements such as the protons of hydrogen in to helium, which in turn enables the Sun to shine. Were any of these, or several others, slightly changed, we would not be here. "
